I am currently a PhD student at Technical University Dresden, Germany, investigating the effects of stress on decision-making in humans using fMRI. My project is part of a collaborative research center studying volition and cognitive control ([CRC 940 Volition and Cognitive Control](https://tu-dresden.de/bereichsuebergreifendes/sfb940/research/b-modulatoren/b5)). Specifically, I am interested in how acute and chronic stress might alter how we anticipate the consequences of our own actions and how this potentially biases decision-making in goal-directed behavior. While combining behavioral tasks with fMRI and the collection of biomarkers of acute and chronic stress, I am striving to incorporate Open Science practices into my research and contribute to more reproducibility in Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychoneuroendorinology.
